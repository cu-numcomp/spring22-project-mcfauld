# bacon-sci
A Rust crate that includes many different scientific computing features.

## About the Crate 
This crate was created by github user aftix. The crate includes many features such as initial value problem solving using Runge-Kutta methods, 
root finding with Newton's method, and differentiation. [Here is a link to the repository](https://github.com/aftix/bacon)

## Motivation
I've been using Rust extensively for my computer science capstone project and, because I enjoy quite a bit, I'd like to explore more. 

## Proposed Experiment
I think it would be interesting to experiment with differentiation in particular as there are multiple differentiation crates available in rust
and it would be interesting to compare them to this one.
